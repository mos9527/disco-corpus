# Make Titus give up Ruby's location
# Ruby was the organizer of the hanging. She's also *missing*, but the Hardie boys will be tight-lipped about her location. You need to get them to open up. Have you *fully* explored the Whirling? Analysed the site of the murder? Truly and *thoroughly* interrogated Klaasje? All this might make convincing them easier.
