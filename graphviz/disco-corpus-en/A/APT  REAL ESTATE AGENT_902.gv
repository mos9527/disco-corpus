	  6 [label="Real Estate Agent: It feels flimsy in hand, with the words 'Revachol Zone of Control' written under a nondescript municipal logo. There's a picture of her with shorter hair inside, along with all her personal details."];
	  7 [label="Composure: A sudden serious look crosses her face. This story didn't have a happy ending."];
	  8 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Very well, but please make it quick.\" She slips the passport back to her purse and checks her watch. \"I need to be back in La Delta in an hour.\""];

	  14 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Satisfied? My name is Marielle Charpentier and I'm an agent with Martinaise Realty Associates. I am *not* breaking in, as I have every *right* to be here. The keys, see?\" She jingles a set of keys in her hand."];
	  15 [label="You: Inspect the passport."];
	  16 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"But -- that was months ago. Anyway. Was there anything you wanted, or is that it? I'm in a hurry.\""];
	  17 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Don't ask me what happened with the wall, I have no idea how we're going to find the time or resources to fix it.\""];
	  18 [label="You: \"My money has also disappeared, I think.\""];
	  19 [label="Rhetoric: The *radiocomputer wizards* are invested with magical economic powers."];
	  20 [label="You: \"I don't need your ID, I just need to ask you some questions.\""];
	  21 [label="You: \"Who lived in the foreclosed apartment down the hallway?\""];

	  24 [label="You: \"Who lived here?\""];
	  25 [label="Electrochemistry: So preppy! She's probably on some low grade performance enhancers. Like Preptide or Pericanine."];
	  26 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"And again, I have no idea how *stupid* mistakes like this can even happen, but Ron, when he came to close the door, didn't close the neighbouring door! And there's a hole in the wall!\""];

	  32 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"What now?\" She crosses her arms impatiently."];
	  33 [label="Empathy: Her voice is really cheerful despite her obviously *hating* you."];
	  34 [label="Inland Empire: It's as if they're *real* wizards, able to resurrect dead real estate and breathe life into bank accounts."];
	  35 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Everyone says that real estate agents don't *do* anything, but here I am, in the middle of the night, cleaning up someone's 'crash pad'.\""];
	  36 [label="Endurance: Come to think of it, she *does* look incredibly tired."];
	  37 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Oh, that's another huge mess. The former tenant owes us three months of rent, *three*! We closed the apartment and planned on auctioning off the valuables, but...\""];
	  38 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"*Both* apartments are now unrentable. Both!\" She's still shaking her head, manicured hands now crossed over the chest."];
	  39 [label="Interfacing: Boy there are a lot of different keys there. More than *twenty* at least..."];
	  40 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"It *is*.\" She breathes in and out to the count of three -- it looks like some special stress release technique -- before she continues..."];
	  41 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"So, the sooner we get this over with, the better.\" She means you -- time for the next question."];
	  42 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Do you want to see my ID as well? You can't *legally* ask for it, but why not? Want to see my residence permit, too?\" She fumbles through her purse, fishing out a light paper-clad passport."];
	  43 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"These apartments are perfectly fine! They have gorgeous architecture, a million reÃ¡l view of the bay, good ventilation, neighbours, life, spark... And they are affordable.\""];

	  51 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"It was some kind of a moribund old man, who used to be a business owner. You'd think they'd make rent...\" She stops, hesitating."];
	  52 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"Of course,\" she replies with a smile, but her eyes remain glazed over -- she's been waiting for you to leave."];
	  53 [label="Jump to: [minihubo]"];
	  54 [label="Real Estate Agent: \"A hole in the wall, can you believe it?\" She spreads her hands. \"And then the tenant ran off with his stuff. He's gone, the *money's* gone, just like that!\" She snaps her fingers."];
	  55 [label="You: \"Isn't it a bit late to be working?\""];
	  56 [label="You: \"Sounds like they knew how to have a good time.\""];
