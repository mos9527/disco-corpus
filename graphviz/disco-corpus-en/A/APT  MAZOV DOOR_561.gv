# APT / MAZOV DOOR
# DOOR, APARTMENT #11 (turns into door. can lockpick and get into?)
#
#1. Use the wirecutters to cut the chain.
#If you don't have them, the door suggests it. The chain is very flimsy. 
#Exactly the same structure as other doors. 
#
#1. Observe the padlock. - the weakness here is in chain.
#
#Option to get a task if you do not have the chaincutters.
