# APT / CUNO DAD
# Cuno's dad, loitering on the bed. Drugs. Sleeping with his eyes open. His face reminds you Cuno 30 years later. Also seems like he's dead. Hairy ginger chest, in undewear. Kim reacts. Hearing redcheck while he gurgles, success: he's trying to call you pigs. 
#
#
#I talked to your dad boolean. / I was somehow able to not evade your dad.
