# DOOMED / ICE BEAR FRIDGE
# 1. Has a note inside that points to the frozen ice cream maker that has the filament memory stored inside.
#2. Reacting to the fact that there's a giant ice bear fridge still running them a loss.
#3. This is where you put the hanged man. If hub reached then this is an instant solution for TASK.find_fridge / If has TASK.find_fridge then this is the solution.
#4. The fridge can be turned off from the breaker box.
