# KINEEMA / SERIAL NUMBER
# 1. Ask Alice to run the serial number you got from the boot.
#2. Come back the next day to get results and ask for Alice to try to get more personal info on the mercenary (finish task to run serial number, gain task to get personal info from serial number).
#3. Come back the next day to get personal info (finish task to get personal info from serial number).
