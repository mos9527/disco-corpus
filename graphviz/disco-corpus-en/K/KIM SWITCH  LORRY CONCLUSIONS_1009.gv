	  30 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"One way or another, they seem to be -- logistically, if nothing else. But don't expect to bust this open during our stay here. At best, this is an angle we can use against them. To other ends. As extra ammunition.\""];
	  31 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"I'm not sure what the ULAN frequencies are all about, but they may hold some significance. Perhaps it's a better way to connect between fleets while avoiding frequency bleed, or maybe it's used to tap into RCM networks...\""];
