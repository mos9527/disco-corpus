	  16 [label="Visual Calculus: A fleet -- the combined armies of Occident and Graad, with Mesque volunteers. A five-nation army. Hundreds of vessels."];

	  27 [label="Savoir Faire: From the eyes of a seagull: a nest of brown hair not worth the fifty foot dive. From a pedestrian on the dock: a rugged man staring out to sea, mere feet from fatality. From a guest on the balcony of the Whirling-in-Rags: a silhouette imposing enough to be seen at a distance."];
