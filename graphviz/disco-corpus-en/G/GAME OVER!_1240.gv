His death came as something of a surprise to those who knew him, as he'd threatened to kill himself on many previous occasions.\n\n \\"The people who talk about killing themselves all the time aren't usually the ones that do it,\\" said Officer Judit Minot, friend and colleague of the deceased.\n\n \\"The job gets to people in different ways,\\" said Officer Mack Torson, another colleague. \\"Now they're going to start talking about improving counselling services for officers of the RCM again. But, to be honest, I don't think counselling would have helped him.\\"\")"];

The heavily armoured attackers vanished immediately after the bloodbath.\n\n \\"Savage barbarians,\\" Garte a manager of the cafeteria, *Whirling-in-Rags*, commented. \\"They had no respect for the architecture nor the well-being of bystanders.
