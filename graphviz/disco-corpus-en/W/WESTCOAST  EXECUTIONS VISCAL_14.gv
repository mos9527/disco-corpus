# WESTCOAST / EXECUTIONS VISCAL
# An easy PERCEPTION check highlights a scattering of bullet holes in the wall. Pass a medium VISUAL CALCULUS and the interact appears as a ghostly mass execution perpetrated by dotted lines against a row of figures facing the wall. Either way, dialogue with the object has you and Lt Kitsuragi figure out it was an execution after the amphibious assault. You may relive it as an INLAND EMPIRE dream sequence later.
