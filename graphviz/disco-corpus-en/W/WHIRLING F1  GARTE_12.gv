# WHIRLING F1 / GARTE
# ltn Kitsuragi suggests you talk to the manager of the Whirling-in-Rags first. Garte is a hub of knowledge on the area and the case and you will come back to him later. He is also a problem, asking you to pay for the night, to pay for "the damages". It does not reflect well on you.
