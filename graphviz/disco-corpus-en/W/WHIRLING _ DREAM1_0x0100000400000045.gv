	  13 [label="Limbic System: There's this giant ball there. And evil apes. And the evil apes are dukin' it out on the ball. You're one of them. It's basically all just evil apes dukin' it out on a giant ball."];
	  14 [label="You: Who *am* I? What sort of creature does this to their own mouth?!"];
	  15 [label="Ancient Reptilian Brain: Like a fly to the ointment, your conscience sticks to it. The limbed and headed machine of pain and undignified suffering is firing up again. It wants to walk the desert. Hurting. Longing. Dancing to disco music."];
	  16 [label="You: Don't be naive, of course not. I want to sail the inky blackness until forever ends!"];

	  25 [label="Limbic System: An awareness creeps up on you. A mass lies hidden in your dead angle, soaking in some lurid, acidic sauce. It's bloated and shameful, a ball of meat surrounding you... This is a terrible line of questioning, and it will only lead to more awareness of the meat-thing."];
	  26 [label="You: Stop! I don't want to hear anything more about this *sensation*. Take me back to the formless, disembodied nothing!\nPlease, no! I changed my mind! Take me back to the formless, disembodied nothing!"];

	  52 [label="Limbic System: Vying for resources? It's just a stupid expression you picked up somewhere. The part of the presentation you want to take home with you is this: you have to beat the other evil apes in the face or you lose."];

	  56 [label="Ancient Reptilian Brain: There. No ball of meat, no light in the formless nothing. Just nightswimming!"];
	  57 [label="Encyclopedia: Somehow you know what it is -- a Coupris Kineema motor carriage."];
	  58 [label="Limbic System: You can't even make out it's a ball, when you're dukin' it out. It's that large."];

	  64 [label="Ancient Reptilian Brain: Ex-love, ex-tenderness. It is foolish of you to resurface to the loss. Not after all the damage you suffered to get here, some of it irreversible... Stay, sail with me through the Abyssopelagic Zone!"];
	  65 [label="You: Okay, I'm a bit scared now. Let's go back to the dark."];
	  66 [label="You: Mother, help me, there's a head attached to my neck and I'm *in* it."];
	  67 [label="Encyclopedia: The sound outside -- you recognize it. It's a Coupris Kineema motor carriage."];

	  70 [label="You: What do you mean *drowned*?"];
	  71 [label="Limbic System: A fiery streak penetrates your skull, trying to force your eyes open. It's a sound. A clarion call from hell."];
