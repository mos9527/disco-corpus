# WHIRLING / KIM INTRO
# Downstairs ltn Kim Kitsuragi - precinct 57th's finest - is waiting to solve THE HANGED MAN with you as an inter-district co-op. It would appear Precinct 41 sent you to investigate the lynching of a "Whitewater mercenary" in "Martinaise". And that you are indeed a police officer. Kim briefs you on the case and your relationship begins - likely on the wrong foot, but not necessarily.
