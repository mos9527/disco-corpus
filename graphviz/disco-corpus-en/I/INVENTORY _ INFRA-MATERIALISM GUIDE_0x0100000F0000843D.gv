	  9 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: In some of his later writings, Nilsen himself speculated about the potential for an *extra-physical architecture* that disregards the laws of 'bourgeois physics' and instead relies on the revolutionary faith of the people for structural integrity."];

	  68 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Stay with us a moment longer. What's more, Nilsen speculated that this plasm, when it becomes powerful enough, might begin to *influence* the material reality surrounding it. Hence the name: *infra-materialism*."];

	  89 [label="Inland Empire: No-no-no. There's *something* here, you can feel it!"];
	  90 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: At the lowest, or *first level*, revolutionary plasm is believed to stimulate or invigorate matter without altering its essential properties."];
	  91 [label="You: This sounds like that business with the turnips..."];
	  92 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Your hand feels clammy against your bare chin. You wipe it along the back of the book and keep reading..."];
	  93 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: That's correct! Reports from the Revolutionary period claim that the most radically devoted communards were able to engage in vigorous intercourse for up to *eight hours* at a time."];
	  94 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"My apologies, I thought leaving your partner hanging was simply the style at the 41st.\""];

	  99 [label="You: This feels like kid stuff. Is there no Slightly Longer Glance(TM) series?"];
	  100 [label="Inland Empire: That's not right at all. Thoughts don't exist in the brain, they float through the *air*! Your brain is but a fish swimming through them..."];
	  101 [label="Endurance: Maybe if you're some kind of binoclard. *You* on the other hand, are a gut-thinker, through and through."];
	  102 [label="You: Honestly, I have no idea where some of these thoughts come from."];
	  103 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Unfortunately, Nilsen passed away before he was able to develop these initial ideas into a full-fledged theory. *That* work was left to subsequent generations of communist theorists..."];

	  105 [label="You: Stroke your bare chin."];

	  107 [label="mental projection"];
	  108 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: It's become something of a folk legend that during their final meeting, Nilsen and Mazov didn't speak a single word, preferring to sit in silence with their chamomile tea, reading one another's thoughts."];
	  109 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: The communards were notoriously under-equipped against the much better-funded Coalition. In any event, it's doubtful even ceramic armour would have altered the outcome."];
	  110 [label="Conceptualization: Yes, you have a little cabinet for organizing and storing them away."];
	  111 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: During his final years in exile, he produced, among other things, an early guide to homebrewing, instructions for raising revolutionary children, plans for a universal pictographic language, and a detailed materialist critique of Dolores Dei's chess strategy."];
	  112 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Building on Nilsen's basic insight, these theorists reached a startling conclusion: that a sufficiently revolutionary state might begin to exhibit certain *extra-physical* effects based on the amount of plasm generated by its citizens."];
	  113 [label="You: I'm completely lost."];
	  114 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Even today, in parts of the SRV there are collective farms whose root vegetable yields exceed those thought possible by capitalist agronomists."];

	  116 [label="Inland Empire: Why are you getting hung up on mechanisms... Open your mind's aperture just a little wider! You're so close to true understanding!"];

	  118 [label="You: \"Cease to be laws...\" What do they become then?"];
	  119 [label="You: What would a third-level society even look like? (Conclude.)"];
	  120 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: According to communard lore, these acolytes positioned themselves at the top of a redoubt just over the Bay of Revachol. From that vantage, they proceeded to visualise *pinching* Coalition Warship Debutante between their fingers, a gesture believed to assist in the extra-physical materialisation of their thoughts."];
	  121 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: It's a matter of fierce debate what form society would assume under the highest levels of revolutionary plasm, also known as 'Full Communism' or, as Nilsen termed it, 'Communism Above Reality'."];
	  122 [label="You: That's... strangely beautiful."];
	  123 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Among known attempts to channel third-level capabilities, the most well-documented is the curious case of Coalition Warship Debutante."];

	  125 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: The back of the book contains four or five pages of primary and secondary sources, but you'd need access to a university library to find most of them."];
	  126 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: \"We may yet discover,\" he wrote in his notebooks, \"that under certain, exceptional circumstances, the proletariat's embrace of historical materialism may be *so fervent* that their beliefs take form in the world of matter as a kind of revolutionary 'plasm'.\""];

	  128 [label="Endurance: Eight hours? There's no way. Your equipment would be mashed to jelly."];
	  129 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Most infra-materialists would argue that the inability of skeptics to detect plasm is simply evidence of their own insufficient revolutionary enthusiasm."];
	  130 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Under suitably revolutionary conditions, you might be! Though infra-materialists would argue that it's more like the community is *collectively* the law."];
	  131 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: Correct. Though certain particulars of the theory are commonly attributed to Nilsen himself, the *evidentiary* basis of those attributions has always been a point of contention between infra-materialists and their critics."];

	  143 [label="You: How exactly does the plasm 'stimulate' matter?"];
	  144 [label="A Brief Look at Infra-Materialism: The difference in these yields was simply too great to be accounted for by mere climate or soil conditions. The only reasonable explanation, infra-materialists argue, is the high level of revolutionary plasm emanating from the commune itself."];
