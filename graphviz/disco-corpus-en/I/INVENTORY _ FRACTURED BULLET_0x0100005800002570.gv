# INVENTORY / FRACTURED BULLET
# By inspecting the bullet, you can find out that:
#1. The bullet came from a breech-loaded rifle.
#2. The bullet was shot from some distance, so this was probably not a mercy kill (white check.)
#3. The rifle used was a model mass-produced during the revolutionary war, and the surplus rifles/ammo are still a favourite with third-world guerrillas and Jamrock bangers.
