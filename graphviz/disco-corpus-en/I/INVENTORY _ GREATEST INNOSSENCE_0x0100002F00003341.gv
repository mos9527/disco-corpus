	  7 [label="The Greatest Innocence: Incorrect. Sola was anointed during the previous century and even lived to see the current one.  She was an urban planner who spoke her mind and largely left history to its own devices, encouraging people to excel on their own rather than prescribing to a deified model of history. She is often called an *anti-innocence*."];
	  8 [label="The Greatest Innocence: Incorrect. Dolores Dei was the innocence of humanism, internationalism, and the welfare state. She codified parliamentary democracy and created modern institutions, among these the Moralintern. She was powerful. And beautiful, on all her icons..."];
	  9 [label="You: Dolores Dei."];
	  10 [label="The Greatest Innocence: The most famous -- and important -- of these  was Ernö Pasternak. He was into torture, despotism, hymns, cannons, and world conquest, but got defeated and humiliated by Stepan the Despicable of Kedra."];

	  14 [label="Encyclopedia: Got it under control. No problem. Solid on this one. It's wide-spread historical information."];
	  15 [label="The Greatest Innocence: Correct! There have been a number of counter- or false-innocences -- some assumed to have innocentic qualities, some who just thought so themselves. Occasionally they have the support of a faction inside the ecclesiastic organization, and accusations of foul play have arisen..."];

	  22 [label="Jump to: [qonehub]"];
	  23 [label="The Greatest Innocence: Correct! Named the innocence of militarism, he codified hereditary rule -- but at the same time ended serfdom and established the interisolary reál as the global reserve currency. He also established the concept of the Nation."];

	  31 [label="The Greatest Innocence: Correct! Nothing much is known about him. It's not even clear that he was a *he*, but Franconegro presumed as such and called him Pius. He's depicted as a young man with molten gold pouring out of his mouth -- all he spoke was gold. It's said he *invented* god; and equality of men before god. He also introduced the gold standard as a way for measuring people's love for aurum."];

	  42 [label="Encyclopedia: Zero doubts."];
	  43 [label="The Greatest Innocence: ... an A. All correct. Impressive, *oddly* so.\n... an F! For *Failure*. Ha ha ha.\n... a D. Not particularly remarkable, but technically a passing grade. Not that anyone really expected better.\n... a C. Vaguely passable. A solid effort with nothing much else to show. Nice going, mediocrity-man.\n... a B. Good enough.
