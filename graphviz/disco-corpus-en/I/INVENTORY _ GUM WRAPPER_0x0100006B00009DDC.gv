	  4 [label="Jump to: [main_thought_hub]"];
	  5 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: The sun sets into the sea, but the water does not boil. Instead it turns to liquid gold. For a moment, the world's store of precious metals seems to increase dramatically, and you are rich..."];
	  6 [label="You: Ancient temple?"];
	  7 [label="Encyclopedia: You feel compelled to point out that there's nothing fruity about cinnamon -- It's a spice derived from tree bark."];
	  8 [label="Encyclopedia: Whatever petrochemical by-products they used to create this artificial flavour have bonded tightly to the wrapper. Or is that just your memory, filling in the gaps?"];

	  11 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: There is a movement next to you. The shuffle of a small coat. Warm, like the evening. But when you turn toward it there's nothing there..."];
	  12 [label="Inland Empire: You carefully fold the wrapper into a square, before putting it back into your pocket. Lovingly even -- despite the strange feeling of regret."];
	  13 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: ... until a blossom of skin and flower petals erupts behind your closed eyes. Made of toffee, cream, and distance. You just *had* to take a dive."];
	  14 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: Yes. From the height of antiquity. A long, long time ago. Millennia ago. On an island of time you can never return to."];
	  15 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: Bitter, citrus, sweet, it seems to grow stronger, like a glow, with every breath you take..."];
	  16 [label="Inland Empire: Feels very, very familiar. Harry. Please. You were supposed to discard it."];

	  27 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: You neatly fold the wrapper into a square before you put it back into your pocket. Carefully. Lovingly even..."];
	  28 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: Good question, There is no answer or secret phrase written on the inside of the wrapper. Yet you're drawn to it."];

	  33 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: A crinkled chewing gum wrapper. The worn label reads: 'Tutti Frutti.' It smells faintly of apricots, with a barely noticeable twinge of cinnamon."];
	  34 [label="Inland Empire: Drawn by regret. Stop, before you *hurt* yourself with the Tutti Frutti wrapper. Throw it away, please."];

	  36 [label="Apricot Chewing Gum Wrapper: Can a used wrapper shrug? It seems like that's what the wrapper is doing, somehow. This is not about flowers, or bark? What *is* this about? Why are you looking at this wrapper?"];
	  37 [label="You: Why do I even care about this?"];
	  38 [label="Jump to: [no_ledger_hub]"];
