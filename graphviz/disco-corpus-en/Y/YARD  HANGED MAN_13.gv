# YARD / HANGED MAN
# A corpse hangs from the pine-tree: a middle aged man in white armour boots and tighty whities. A medium PERCEPTION white-check lets you find a bullet hole in the back of his mouth, a low LOGIC white check that he was killed before hanging. A low THOUGHT CABINET w-c sees that the bullet is antique.
