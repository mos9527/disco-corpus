	  2 [label="Authority: Honourable One, you have accumulated a substantial amount of honour points on your life-path. You are a man most virtuous."];
	  3 [label="You: \"I am honouring myself, lieutenant.\""];
	  4 [label="youbringhonour"];
	  5 [label="Authority: Living in the name of virtue and doing noble deeds while expecting nothing in return is not *archaic*. How can you even think that?"];
	  6 [label="Authority: Yes. Your deeds have spoken for you, Honourable One, but to fully drape one's self in an eternal cloak of honour a ritual must be completed. A *Rite of Honour*..."];
	  7 [label="Authority: Good. That was a lie most honourable. Sometimes we must hide the truth from those who wouldn't understand it. The Less-Honoured Ones."];
	  8 [label="You: Hold your horses! This is a mistake. Honour is meaningless to me. [Discard thought.]"];
	  9 [label="Authority: People will be in awe, admiring a police officer most honourable in a sacred ritual of uttermost righteousness."];
	  10 [label="Authority: The lieutenant is a noble man, but he does not *know* honour like you and I do. Best not to waste time trying to explain. Lead by example."];
	  11 [label="Authority: Go forth and commit even more honourable deeds. And should your resolve ever waiver, remember The Rite of Honour. It will always cleanse a man's soul..."];
	  12 [label="Authority: No, no, no! You see, you're putting the needs of *others* above *yours*. *You* get nothing in return -- not even praise. You always get the short, *noble* end of the stick..."];
	  13 [label="Authority: Congratulations, Honourable One! You have become a member of a noble faculty. A man kneels, an Honour Cop rises..."];
	  14 [label="Authority: Selflessness forms the basis for the warrior code. An ageless code, as fit for nomadic Iilmaraan tribes traversing the vast Red Plateau in Provincia Gurdi as it is for your neighbourhood postman."];
	  15 [label="You: \"Nothing, you wouldn't understand. It's an honour thing.\""];
	  16 [label="You: Wait, there were honour points?"];
	  17 [label="You: My honour is my life."];
	  18 [label="Authority: Then they will witness honour so great it seems nigh impossible a single man can contain it. They will admire you, Honourable One."];
	  19 [label="IsExterior()"];
	  20 [label="IsExterior()", shape=diamond];
	  21 [label="!(IsExterior())", shape=diamond];
	  22 [label="Authority: Mhmh-mhmh, you are like a wondering knight-monk setting right the wrongs of the world you come upon."];
	  23 [label="You: My honour is my life. It's what separates me from the treacherous wÃ¶men."];
	  24 [label="Authority: Honour comes from deep within you and to truly know oneself, to *know* one's honour, one must reach deep within oneself and *touch* one's honour..."];
	  25 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"The big deal?\" The lieutenant rolls his eyes. \"I guess we really do come from different upbringings...\""];
	  26 [label="You: Okay..."];
	  27 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"I can see that, but do you have to do it where everyone can see you?\" He looks shocked."];
	  28 [label="Authority: You brought much shame on your family today. Your name will forever be tarnished by this most shameful of deeds. Be forever banished, Shameful One!"];
	  29 [label="You: This honour thing feels overwhelming. Maybe I should open my heart to it?"];
	  30 [label="You: What? I don't know... just like that? Outside? What about people?"];
	  31 [label="Authority: You're right. The lieutenant, although a noble man, does not understand honour like you do. Best not to waste time trying to explain. Lead by example."];
	  32 [label="Authority: Don't think about it too much! Just say it -- are you ready to get knee-deep in honour?"];
	  33 [label="Jump to: [youbringhonour]"];
	  34 [label="Authority: You are on the fast track to becoming one of the rarest, most revered of all police officers -- an honour cop."];
	  35 [label="Authority: Are you ready to drink deep from the cup of honour?"];
	  36 [label="Authority: Good. You feel its presence. Now you are ready for the *Rite of Honour*."];
	  37 [label="You: You're not hearing me. I'm not some creepy honour-lover. Period."];
	  38 [label="Authority: Oh, the modesty on this one. Another 10 honour points for you, sir!"];
	  39 [label="You: It sounds rather arrogant, a secretive self-regard."];
	  40 [label="Authority: It is an honour to serve with you, Honour Cop!"];
	  41 [label="You: \"Scratching my ass. What's the big deal?\""];
	  42 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Well... uh... don't!\" The lieutenant looks truly shocked."];
	  43 [label="Half Light: No! You're not a snivelling shit-heel chasing imaginary karma-coupons! Not for this, nor the afterlife! Fuck this honour shit!"];
	  44 [label="You: Isn't honour sort of an archaic concept?"];
	  45 [label="IsKimHere()"];
	  46 [label="IsKimHere()", shape=diamond];
	  47 [label="!(IsKimHere())", shape=diamond];
	  48 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!\" The lieutenant jumps away from you."];
	  49 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Then why are you elbow deep in your pants like...\" He suddenly stops as if realizing he doesn't want to hear the answer. \"Never mind, officer. Carry on.\""];
	  50 [label="Authority: You need to bring the thumb of your right hand -- your sword hand -- to your rectum and stick it in there to form the Arch of Honours."];
	  51 [label="You: All I ever wanted was to live with dignity -- to die with honour. (Stick your thumb in your ass.)"];
	  52 [label="You: I don't want this. I really don't care about honour... at all."];
	  53 [label="Authority: Ah... ahhh. You continue to display such humility. This is to be admired! Refusing praise for your personal integrity is most honourable indeed."];
	  54 [label="You: A warrior code, you say... I do feel like a warrior. This whole thing is beginning to sound very *me*."];
	  55 [label="You: You're crazy if you think I'm just going to stick a finger in my ass! NO WAY!"];
	  56 [label="You: \"Who, me? Nothing. I'm doing nothing, Kim.\""];
	  57 [label="Authority: Meaningless?! Vulgar knave, how dare you besmirch the honour of honour points... It hurts the eyes to look upon filth like you. Begone."];
	  58 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Really? It seems more like a personal hygiene thing.\" He leans even more away from you. \"But let's not delve deeper.\""];
	  59 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Have you no self control?\" Then realizing the naivete of the question he looks at the ground. \"Please spare me this sight.\""];
	  60 [label="Authority: Of course there were honour points. Did you think no one was paying attention to all of your honourable deeds, Honourable One?"];
	  61 [label="Authority: Most dishonourable are those who have known honour, carried honour in their hearts, and then disowned honour. They are the *honourfallen*..."];
	  62 [label="You: What? What if someone comes and *sees* me?"];
	  63 [label="You: I only try my best. It's the most any of us can do."];
	  64 [label="Authority: Even among the honourable only the most dignified are deemed worthy -- but you, oh honourable one, have excelled... in honour."];
