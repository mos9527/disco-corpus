# Look for Ruby on the coast
# Ruby was in the cinderblock village but left Monday. She could be anywhere on the peninsula, north of the village. Look inside the church. Ask around, there are people to the west of the mural. Or, I don't know... ask a girl on a date? Then ask her? Ask the wind maybe?
