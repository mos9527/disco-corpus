	  3 [label="Electrochemistry: Yeah... what's the problem here?"];
	  4 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Of course it has.\" He doesn't even look too surprised."];
	  5 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: ...but then he turns away -- his gaze fixed on the road ahead. \"Let's go,\" he concludes."];
	  6 [label="Esprit de Corps: We're all under stress. This is turning into a great big mess. I'm not judging. Just keep it together."];
	  7 [label="Horrific Necktie: Feels good. Feels safe."];
	  8 [label="Horrific Necktie: The lifeless necktie looks like a colourful intestine of some dead animal: oily, alien and otherwise disgusting. What could have driven a man to wear something so repulsive around his neck?"];
	  9 [label="Empathy: He's struggling to keep silent, but finally seems to give up."];
	  10 [label="Rhetoric: He doesn't actually believe it's wonderful."];
	  11 [label="Horrific Necktie: Hush-hush, *bratan*, now is not the time to celebrate, now is the time to get *ready*. Trust me on this. This is what it's all been building towards. It's gonna be off the hook. Off *all* hooks."];
	  12 [label="You: Now what?"];
	  13 [label="Horrific Necktie: Just put me in the bottle, *bratan*. I'm not gonna let you down. You and I are, like, the same person."];
	  14 [label="Horrific Necktie: No, *bratan*, no need for that. You and I are *bratannoi* -- brothers. Brothers fight. But when they're done fighting, you know what they do? They party. They fucking party!"];
	  15 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"That makes absolutely no sense.\" He thinks for a moment. \"But I guess every family has its own traditions.\""];
	  16 [label="You: \"Forget it, you're not *open-minded* enough to understand anyway.\""];
	  17 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"I've got to ask...\" he says, a peculiar look in his eyes. \"What are you doing?\""];
	  18 [label="You: \"It mostly urges me to party harder.\""];

	  20 [label="You: \"Mind your own business, binoclard!\""];
	  21 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"That makes two of us.\" He shakes his head slowly. \"Let's not waste any more time under this boardwalk. We need to clear this all up... somehow.\""];
	  22 [label="You: \"We're buds. Mostly just goofing around.\""];
	  23 [label="You: Cork the bottle and put it away."];
	  24 [label="You: \"It started when I woke up in the Whirling-in-Rags. It's been talking to me ever since.\""];
	  25 [label="Horrific Necktie: *Bratan*, have I ever lied to you? Just take me off. (The necktie tugs encouragingly at your neck.)"];
	  26 [label="You: Begone, foul necktie! Finally I rid myself of you! (End it. Throw the necktie as far as you can.)"];
	  27 [label="Horrific Necktie: The necktie floats in the blueish liquid with almost unearthly grace."];
	  28 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"No harm? In drinking 98.7% alcohol with a god-knows-how-old tie in it? I wouldn't be so sure.\" The lieutenant tilts his head slightly. \"However, I'm not here to judge. Let's go.\""];
	  29 [label="You: What? I didn't know I could do that..."];
	  30 [label="You: Get lost, necktie! I don't want to be your friend."];
	  31 [label="Horrific Necktie: *Bratan*, life and death are inseparable. There's a party when you're born, a party every year to celebrate that birth, and a party when you're put in the ground."];

	  33 [label="Jump to: [You: \"Necktie, you and I are done. Both p...\"]"];
	  34 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Right. Okay. Anyway, I'm glad you told me your necktie has been speaking to you. That must not have been easy.\" For a second it looks like he's about to add something..."];
	  35 [label="You: Take the necktie off."];
	  36 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Okay. So why did you put it in the bottle?\""];
	  37 [label="You: I suspect that it might be."];
	  38 [label="You: So... what next?"];
	  39 [label="You: \"In my family when someone dies you put a piece of clothing in a bottle as a sign of eternal respect.\""];
	  40 [label="Horrific Necktie: But, *bratan*... I... I understand. (The tie loosens around your neck.) I just wanted you to have fun. I... I never meant to be a burden."];
	  41 [label="Shivers: Howling somewhere, lashing the boardwalk with brine and rain -- an ancient warmth crawls under your skin."];
	  42 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"And what has the necktie been telling you, if I may ask?\""];
	  43 [label="You: Go away necktie. You're just a figment of my imagination."];
	  44 [label="You: \"Signs of some really hard core mental illness, Kim.\" (Point to your head.)"];
	  45 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"I would assume, yes. Why did you put it in the bottle?\""];
	  46 [label="Horrific Necktie: Your fingers manage to undo the oily knot and the necktie slides off. It looks so frail sitting there in your hand, weighing almost nothing."];
	  47 [label="You: Necktie?"];
	  48 [label="Horrific Necktie: Trust me -- just trust me. You and I are going to have so much fun it should be illegal!"];
	  49 [label="You: But that's *too much fun*."];
	  50 [label="Inland Empire: It was just trying to help...."];
	  51 [label="Horrific Necktie: *Bratan*, don't push me away. I want to be there for you. Also -- how can you be sure *you* are not just a figment of *my* imagination?"];
	  52 [label="You: But... why?"];
	  53 [label="You: You know what, I'm done with this crazy talking necktie bullshit!"];
	  54 [label="Conceptualization: It's like an organic sample brought back from a distant star system inhabited by sentient neckwear."];
	  55 [label="Inland Empire: Seems you'll never learn the answer to that question."];
	  56 [label="You: Time for what?"];
	  57 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Let us not linger. We have a great big mess to figure out.\" He turns to face the road ahead."];
	  58 [label="You: \"I simply don't know.\""];
	  59 [label="You: Wait, right now? A woman just died and you think now is a good time to party?"];
	  60 [label="You: Wait, right now? Ruby's gone. I don't really think there's anything to celebrate here."];

	  65 [label="You: Put the necktie tie in the bottle."];
	  66 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: The lieutenant has been observing you quietly all this time."];
	  67 [label="You: Okay, then tell me -- it is time for what?"];
	  68 [label="You: \"Why not, lieutenant?\""];
	  69 [label="Horrific Necktie: Now put me in the bottle."];
	  70 [label="Horrific Necktie: Oh... you will see. (It feels like the tie is rubbing itself against your chest like a cat in heat.)"];
	  71 [label="You: \"I don't really know, but I'm eager to find out.\""];
	  72 [label="You: \"Because it told me to.\""];
	  73 [label="You: \"In my family, you put a piece of clothing in some hard liquor and drink it for good luck. It's silly, but no harm done, right?\""];
	  74 [label="Horrific Necktie: As the necktie slides into the purifying liquid, large stains of grease rise off from it and float to the surface. There they quickly dissolve and disappear completely."];
	  75 [label="You: \"It teaches me about life, Kim. Sort of a father figure.\""];
	  76 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Wonderful. Very useful.\""];
	  77 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"A relationship between a man and a talking necktie? No, apparently I am not.\" His voice rings of insincere sadness as he turns to leave."];
	  78 [label="Horrific Necktie: Cleansed by the blue spirit-fire of 98.7% pure alcohol, the fabric looks almost new again. No longer like a disgusting worm of the lower intestine, but like a colourful and deadly poisonous reef-snake of the Insulindian ocean."];
	  79 [label="You: Slowly uncork the blue medicinal spirit."];
	  80 [label="Horrific Necktie: The bottle opens with a silent, mysterious hiss. The fumes rising from its mouth are as crisp as the northern winds."];
	  81 [label="You: Necktie, you and I are done. Both professionally -- and as friends. Begone! (End the tie.)"];
	  82 [label="Horrific Necktie: *Bratan*, now is the time!"];
	  83 [label="Horrific Necktie: First, the spirits -- the blue medicinal spirits. Grab the bottle and uncork it! It is time to unleash the Other-World."];
	  84 [label="Horrific Necktie: There is silence."];
	  85 [label="Horrific Necktie: Why shouldn't there be a party when you die? And, beside, this isn't even about that! You have no idea what this is about... this is gonna be so off the hook. It's gonna be off *all* hooks."];
	  86 [label="Horrific Necktie: But, *bratan*... no. Please uncork it. I can make it good again."];
	  87 [label="Drama: As always -- lie."];
	  88 [label="You: Necktie... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that."];
	  89 [label="Horrific Necktie: Now, *bratan*, take me off."];
	  90 [label="Horrific Necktie: The oily rag flaps miserably in the air and lands close by in the dirt. It looks like an inanimate object, completely devoid of life."];
