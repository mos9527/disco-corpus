# JAM / PALEDRIVER
# A small, old, shrivelled up mesque woman with thinning hair sits awkwardly on the ledge of a lorry. An empty, glazed look adorns her eyes. She murmurs while nodding her head to the music coming from a radio in her lorry cabin. She wears a squared truck-driver flannel shirt with sleeves wrapped up to her elbows and blue denim dungarees tucked in yellow-brown (Caterpillar) boots.
