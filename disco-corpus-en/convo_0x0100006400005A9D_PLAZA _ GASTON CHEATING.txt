	  5 [label="Half Light: ... aaaaaand that's how you break a man if the good cop and the bad cop have left for the day. Disturbing Cop to the rescue!"];
	  6 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Uh... thanks. Is there something we can help you with, officer?\" He avoids your gaze."];

	  16 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Of course, officer.\" He waits for you to speak."];
	  17 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Well... first you draw a circle about a half a metre in diameter. We made ours out of rope,\" he explains. \"Then the order of play is determined by a coin toss. You win it -- you get to throw the *cochonnet*.\""];

	  22 [label="You: \"Interesting. Tell me more about it.\""];
	  23 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Then the players aim to throw their *boules* as close to the *cochonnet* as possible. They must stay in the circle and keep both feet planted.\""];
	  24 [label="René Arnoux: \"Why don't the two of you get a tomb and take your whining there.\" He looks at you, disgusted. \"I am ashamed to even stand in the same crater with you.\""];

	  27 [label="René Arnoux: \"Six months go by and I realize you must think I've gone blind from all the shrapnel in my head. Because only a blind man wouldn't see through that.\""];

	  29 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Easy now, René.\" He snickers. \"I *will* join the seniors swimming class later, but right now I don't want to keep the officer waiting -- police business is usually urgent.\""];
	  30 [label="Gaston Martin: \"Yes, yes. I'm sorry, officer.\" The senior is visibly shaking before you."];

	  37 [label="René Arnoux: \"You were a rat when we were boys and you are a rat now. Of course I knew!\" He spits. \"Your deception was so bad at first I thought you were play-acting for my amusement.\""];
	  38 [label="You: \"Trivial? Ha. Ahaha.\" (Grin at the man.) \"You can still tell me, you know. Before anything *happens*.\""];
	  39 [label="Gaston Martin: \"That's the *cochonnet*.\" He points to a small wooden ball in the middle of the crater."];

	  41 [label="Pain Threshold: That hurt. The man knows where to sting."];

	  43 [label="You: \"Why don't *you* get a tomb yourself!\""];
	  44 [label="René Arnoux: \"Already got one, smart ass.\" He utters through his teeth. \"Comes with the rank and my service record.\""];
