	  2 [label="You: Wait, what about music? Is it art?"];
	  3 [label="Conceptualization: Why does art inspire you so much?"];
	  4 [label="You: No, art is for arrogant blowhards. Why am I getting this?"];
	  5 [label="Conceptualization: Of course not, it's autism. Box-drawing. Masturbation with a ruler and a sextant or whatever they use. You should demean and criticize the genteel institution of architecture. While extolling the virtues of the *pure* arts."];
	  6 [label="Conceptualization: Such vigour! Already you express a sharp descriptive mind, ready to slice through the empty and superficial in favour of the *sublime* and the *beautiful*... Do it. Become the Art Cop. Half art critic -- half cop."];
	  7 [label="Conceptualization: Excellent question. Art is a diverse range of visual, literary, auditory, and performative creativity! It's an expression of imagination and technical skill. Additionally, it's history, criticism and pure enjoyment..."];
	  8 [label="Conceptualization: Bravo! Continue, then, in the mediocre and vulgar epigones of the world. So what if everything is incomprehensibly shit and you can see it. Take no responsibility."];
	  9 [label="Conceptualization: Yes! You seek substance. No vapid representations and reproductions of social mores, as made manifest in stuffy biennials, we're talking real *living art* here. Become the Art Cop. Half art critic -- half cop."];
	  10 [label="Conceptualization: Have you looked in the mirror lately? You have the exact features of a savage art critic, with that beard and those clothes! Dishevelled and *prophetic*. Perhaps you should try to critique architecture too!"];
	  11 [label="Visual Calculus: This was a good call. That guy probably thinks forensics is autism too."];
	  12 [label="Conceptualization: Only the most experimental kind."];
	  13 [label="Conceptualization: In short, art is the highest form of human communication -- representation, narrative, emotion and agency intertwined."];
	  14 [label="Conceptualization: Go ahead and provide savage criticisms, Art Cop. The world is yours to rip to pieces and reassemble!"];
	  15 [label="You: [Discard thought.]"];
	  16 [label="Conceptualization: Exactly. It's not *only* your duty to only catch the criminals of the street, you must also apprehend criminals of the printing press and the gallery -- the trite and derivative artists and writers of the world!"];
	  17 [label="You: That's stupid. Architecture is stupid."];
	  18 [label="You: Would I fit into the art world? I mean..."];
	  19 [label="You: That's stupid. Architecture is stupid. Music is stupid."];
	  20 [label="Untitled hub"];
	  21 [label="You: Okay. If 50% art critic is what's needed to free me from rote repetition, so be it. (Opt in.)"];
	  22 [label="You: I guess I *have* been feeling critical lately."];
	  23 [label="You: It does, yes -- but what *is* art?"];
	  24 [label="Conceptualization: Quit being so indecisive. What are you going for here? Some kind of indecisive and *camp* aesthetic now? Strike a bold shape here. Go art or go home."];
	  25 [label="You: Hold on, is architecture also art?"];
	  26 [label="You: Wait, but don't I have to be 100% cop -- to get the case finished and all that?"];
	  27 [label="You: No. I cannot risk another copo-diversion at this point. Go away! (Opt out.)"];
	  28 [label="Conceptualization: Is it? Yet your eye constantly seeks out the most critical side of any aesthetic confrontation. You follow the expressions of imagination and technical skill with curiosity..."];
