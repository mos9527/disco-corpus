	  5 [label="Logic: There isn't. If only you had more time... more resources... who knows what you could have come up with?"];
	  6 [label="Logic: Okay, sure. A defunct political ideology came and murdered a couple of people. History repeats itself, and the whole cycle starts again..."];

	  12 [label="Conceptualization: Well done, ace detective. You put a dangerous junkie *and* art collector behind bars -- two birds with one stone! Now put your feet up and take a breather."];
	  13 [label="You: The dirty police captain."];

	  16 [label="Logic: Because that's how the world works. Some stories never get finished. You shouldn't expect there to be a tidy, satisfying ending."];

	  18 [label="Logic: Or *that*, yes. Either way, you might've been able to come up with an answer. But not like this."];

	  22 [label="Logic: Sure, yes. They died of an over-abundance of love. Just loved each other to death. Couldn't get enough love. And now they're dead."];
	  23 [label="You: There's got to be a way to solve this."];

	  31 [label="Logic: It still doesn't make sense, but who cares? Yes, Dick Mullen, the famous detective, killed his best friend and a dame he just nailed in cold blood. But why'd he do it? Unclear!"];
