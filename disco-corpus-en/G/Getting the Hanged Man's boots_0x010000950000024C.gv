# Getting the Hanged Man's boots
# In order to succeed 1) the body has to be down, 2) autopsy has to be finished, 3) and Kim has to be absent (he wouldn't approve). This will be *devilishly* tricky, so don't beat yourself up if you manage to send the body to the processing without getting hold of the boots.
