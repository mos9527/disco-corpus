# A shivers afterthought appears after you've clicked through the other orbs available inside the shack. It's a discussion of how it feels to have a new centre of operations, a free home

	  3 [label="Shivers: Overhead you hear the forlorn shriek of seagulls. Far below the birds -- a wooden boardwalk, filled with abandoned stands, tables and benches, echoes from a long lost time."];
	  4 [label="Shivers: You already were a part of their crew once. You can get drunk with them again. You're probably going to hang out there a lot, behind that cinder block house. It's where you belong."];
	  5 [label="Shivers: Outside, the howl of the wind has picked up. The waves crash against the stilts again. It's as if you think the thought, but in someone else's voice..."];
	  6 [label="Shivers: A middle-aged man stands in a run-down shack on the edge of a fishing village. Nothing nods, no one salutes him. No sight of the fugitive."];
	  7 [label="Shivers: Behind the half-built cinder block house at the other end of the village there are three people, drinking. Your *new crew*. You don't need the old crew, oh no, you have a new crew to get drunk with."];
	  8 [label="You: Thank you, strange sensation, for a fair assessment of the current situation."];
	  9 [label="Shivers: This could have been you. This could still be you. A down-on-his-luck nobody, trying to survive."];
	  10 [label="Shivers: A brisk coastal wind still howls against the window of the shack. Occasionally the waves crawl in under the foundation, producing a low hum..."];

	  25 [label="You: No, wait, I changed my mind, I want to choose again."];
	  26 [label="Shivers: Far away, on the corner of Perdition and Main, a nondescript building, obscured in a haze. It's vacant and lost, just like its tenant."];
	  27 [label="Shivers: The room feels muffled, like you pulled your hat over your ears. Outside, it is cold and windy, but you're inside, and it feels safe and warm."];
	  28 [label="You: It's free. That's good enough. I could live here."];
	  29 [label="You: Looks like this is my new home -- wonder where the old one went?"];
	  30 [label="Shivers: In a small shack in the fishing village, a baroque heater hums quietly, emanating a sense of comforting warmth. A washbasin lies on the table, the water inside reflecting the sombre face of the world."];
	  31 [label="Shivers: Far to the southeast, two men and a woman dress themselves in ceramic armour. A shortwave radio hisses on the windowsill. One makes a salute. The other downs a drink. Weapons under the bed..."];
	  32 [label="Shivers: Westward, across the canal, towers the Whirling-in-Rags. Door #1 on the second floor is locked, behind it lies a trashed room. One floor below, behind a counter, stands an irritable man."];
