	  4 [label="Encyclopedia: Exactly. That's what he's known as. His reputation proceeds him!"];
	  5 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"It is *lame*.\""];
	  6 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Not only to you -- I am *Lieutenant Kitsuragi* to everyone.\" He nods. \"Now -- we really need to continue our sweep of what appears to be a secret path through the Whirling.\""];

	  8 [label="Volition: Any plan to call him Pinball or Kimball is immediately wiped from your neocortex, as if with some sort of mind altering device. It is simply not going to happen."];
	  9 [label="You: \"Let's move on then.\" [Finish thought.]"];
	  10 [label="Encyclopedia: Of course, of course. Just something that swam to the surface. Go on, do real police work. This isn't a pinball mystery."];

	  13 [label="Untitled hub"];
	  14 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Okay.\" He thinks for a moment. \"I don't like pinball because I had to learn to play it for an undercover job at a pinball ring. And it's a lame, boring, and unchallenging game -- there. We can move on now.\""];
	  15 [label="Encyclopedia: You still feel he's holding out on Seolite pinball tricks, but fine. Explore on then."];

	  20 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Wonderful. He *only* remembers hearing about the *pinball policeman*.\""];

	  31 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"But even *I* know that they don't play pinball. They have a rigid class society, and a punitive justice system...\" He looks around. \"We should continue with our exploration of this place. It doesn't matter.\""];

	  51 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"Unbelievably,\" he nods. \"To do that I needed to become a... *pinball champion*. I trained for nine months. The job was successful and I was moved out of the juvenile wing -- to homicide.\""];

	  68 [label="You: [Discard thought.]"];
	  69 [label="Kim Kitsuragi: \"No human being should. It is a game that requires no skill and a childlike affinity to flashing lights. And to *fantastique*, science fiction, and historic romance franchises.\""];
